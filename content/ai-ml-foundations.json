  "content": "<div class='content-section'><h3>Overview</h3><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transformative technologies that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This foundational knowledge serves as the entry point to your journey as an AI/ML scientist.</p></div><div class='content-section'><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p>Understanding the difference between AI and ML is crucial: AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider 'smart', while ML is a specific approach to achieve AI focused on the idea that machines should be able to learn from data.</p><p>The field is built upon mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain expertise working together to create systems that can make predictions, decisions, or extract insights from data.</p></div><div class='content-section'><h3>Learning Path</h3><p>Begin by strengthening your fundamentals in mathematics (especially linear algebra, calculus, and probability) and programming (particularly Python). Then progress to understanding basic ML algorithms before diving into specialized subfields like deep learning, reinforcement learning, or natural language processing.</p></div>"
